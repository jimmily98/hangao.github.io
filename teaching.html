        <p class="section-text">
            I believe that education is about igniting a passion for learning within every student. 
            In my class, students are encouraged not only to absorb the course content but also to 
            undertake a self-directed mini-project, 
            which they can explore with the guidance of the professor and teaching assistants.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
            Additionally, understanding the historical context of a course within the broader 
            development of the field is essential. 
            This perspective helps students appreciate where each topic originates 
            and where it may lead. Therefore, special emphasis will be placed during each 
            lecture on introducing the historical development of the subject matter.

      <h3 class="subsection-title">Course Structure</h3>
        <p class="subsection-text">
            We'll begin each class with a 5-minute review of the previous lesson to reinforce key points,
            followed by 45 minutes dedicated to the main content. 
            The first class will serve as an introduction, giving you a big-picture overview of the course.
            During the last class, I'll provide a summary and wrap-up, highlighting the core themes we've
            covered, so I encourage you to attend and enjoy every minute of it.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Attendance</h3>
        <p class="subsection-text">
            While attendance is not mandatory for this course, 
            I highly recommend that you participate in person whenever possible.
            For students unable to attend in person, 
            each session will be recorded and uploaded to Canvas within two hours after class, 
            allowing you to review the material as needed.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Remote Class</h3>
        <p class="subsection-text">
            In case where in-person classes become unfeasible, 
            we will transition to Zoom. 
            The link will be posted on Canvas before the class, 
            so please check the platform regularly for updates.
        </p>

        <h3 class="subsection-title">Questions</h3>
        <p class="subsection-text">
            Questions raised by students are an integral part of this course. 
            Each year, the course is enriched by insightful and inspiring questions from students, 
            so please feel free to raise your hand at any time. 
            However, given the limited time in class, if I'm unable to provide a full answer 
            during the lesson, I encourage you to visit me during my office hours, 
            or send me an email to continue the discussion. 
            Your curiosity and engagement are always welcome! ðŸ˜Š
